FlickrApp
=========

FlickrApp is a simple Flickr application, 
that will provide a form field for entering the name of a place. 
Once the name is entered, the application should fetch and display images from
that location. 

As an example:
when I visit your application homepage, I should be able to enter "Chicago" 
and then when I click submit, I should see images from flickr for that 
particular location. Same goes for any other location I might enter.


Other Requirements for this project are:
-- Django==1.4.1
-- flickrapi
