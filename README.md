FlickrApp
=========

FlickrApp is a simple `Python/Django application`, 
that will provide a form field for entering the name of a place. 
Once the name is entered, the application should make a api request to Flickr and fetch and display images from
that location. 

__As an example:__
<br>when I visit your application homepage, I should be able to enter "Chicago" 
and then when I click submit, I should see images from flickr for that 
particular location. Same goes for any other location I might enter.


Requirements for this project are:
  * Django1.4.1
  * flickrapi
